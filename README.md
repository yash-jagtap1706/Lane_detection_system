# Lane Detection System

This project is a Lane Detection System that utilizes OpenCV for detecting lanes in images and videos. The system features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with PyQt5 and Qt Designer, allowing users to upload images or videos and view lane detection results.

## Features

- **Lane Detection:** Uses OpenCV for lane detection, leveraging Canny edge detection and Hough transformation techniques.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with PyQt5 and designed using Qt Designer to provide an intuitive GUI for selecting images or videos and viewing the results.
- **Real-Time Detection:** Process images or videos in real-time to detect and highlight lanes.

## Project Structure

- `mainWindow.py`: The main Python script that runs the application.
- `ui_mainWindow.ui`: The UI file designed using Qt Designer.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages for running the project.
- `README.md`: This file, containing an overview of the project and instructions for setup.
